You must think you're so smart.
Aww, bless your heart.
Ok, so you're not as dumb as you look.
Life’s good, you should get one.
I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.
Thank you. We’re all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view.
Do they ever shut you up on the plane?
Wait... I’m trying to imagine you with a personality.
You took so long, I got bored.
Me pretending to listen should be enough for you.
What an original point of view!
Thank you so much for your input.
Please, get a life.
What did I do to give you the impression I actually care about what you think?
You’re unique just like everyone else.
I believe in annoyed at first sight.
Remember when I asked for your opinion? Yeah me neither.
Shhhhhhhhhhhh. No one cares.
I would like to confirm that I do not care.
I really don’t care what you think.
I’m sorry, did I ask for your opinion?
